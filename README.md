# SwiftUI App Lifecycle Demo
A practical demonstration of app state management in SwiftUI using scene phases.

## Overview
This project showcases how to effectively monitor and respond to different application states in SwiftUI applications. Instead of relying on traditional AppDelegate methods, we leverage SwiftUI's modern `scenePhase` environment value to track state transitions.

## Features
- Real-time monitoring of app state transitions
- Console logging for state changes
- Clean, minimal implementation using SwiftUI
- Support for all iOS app states:
  - Active (foreground)
  - Inactive (transitional)
  - Background

## Implementation Details
The project consists of two main files:

### LifeCycleApp.swift
The main app file demonstrates:
- Usage of `@Environment(\.scenePhase)`
- State handling with switch cases
- Proper handling of unknown states
- Logging of state transitions

### ContentView.swift
A simple view structure that:
- Provides a basic UI
- Demonstrates SwiftUI view implementation
- Serves as a foundation for UI state responses

## Usage Example
```swift
.onChange(of: scenePhase) { _, phase in
    switch phase {
    case .background:
        // Handle background state
    case .inactive:
        // Handle inactive state
    case .active:
        // Handle active state
    @unknown default:
        // Handle future cases
    }
}
```

## Benefits
* **Simplicity**: Straightforward implementation with minimal code
* **Maintainability**: Clean separation of concerns
* **Future-Proof**: Handles unknown future states
* **Debug-Friendly**: Console logging for easy state tracking

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Open in Xcode
3. Run the project
4. Test different app states by:
   * Minimizing the app
   * Using app switcher
   * Triggering system interruptions

## Requirements
* iOS 17.0+
* Xcode 15.0+
* Swift 5.9+
